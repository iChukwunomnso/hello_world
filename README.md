# hello_world
Hello world, this is my first repository. I'm following the GitHubGuides' steps on this. 
So, i am supposed to tell a little about myself and commit it as an update to the master doc.

I am just curious about coding and what she all about.
i love meeting people - intellectually inspiring ones, not the "in your face" kinds.
